# Nooro-Android-Interview
Nooro take home Android assignment. This is a weather tracker app.

How to setup:
Run the main folder containing the app file on Android Studio.
Then simply run it with a virtual device or physical phone.

How to use:
The search bar will act as an auto searcher with the given term.
With a vague term or nothing for the weather API to follow, it will be empty.
Otherwise one result will show up.

If the user presses onto the city's weather report, it will also save it as a search history.
Once the app is booted up again, the save history will be shown.
